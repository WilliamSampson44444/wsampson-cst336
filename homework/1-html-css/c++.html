            <p>C++ first appeared in 1985, originally referred to as "C with 
            Classes" by its creator Bjarne Stroustrup, of Denmark.<br> Since 
            then, it has grown to be one of the most popular programming 
            languages, thanks to an emphasis on performance and efficiency 
            inherited from C, combined with aspects of object-oriented 
            programming.</p>
