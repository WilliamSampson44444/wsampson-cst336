            <p>Java first appeared in 1995, designed by James Gosling. <br> 
            Java was specifically designed to let application developers "write 
            once, run anywhere" (WORA) in a world where implementation 
            dependencies were a much larger obstacle than they are today. To 
            this end, Java was designed to run on any "Java virtual machine" 
            (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. <br> If you ever 
            encounter trouble while writing a Java program, just remember: 
            "Everything is an Object", and you will be okay.</p>
