            <p>There are an incredible number of different programming languages
            for a Software Developer to choose from, but for most programs, a 
            developer will choose from a much smaller set of languages, each 
            considered to be useful in their own particular way. <br> For this 
            reason, here is some information about three of the most popular 
            programming languages: C++, Java, and Python.</p>
