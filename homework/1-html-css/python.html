            <p>Python first appeared in 1990, designed by Guido van Rossum. <br> 
            Python is a high-level language with at design philosophy essentially 
            aimed at making writing a Python program as close to writing 
            pseudocode as possible. Compared to older languages like C++, Python 
            is much more resource intensive and inefficient, but makes up for it 
            in sheer readability, and ease of writing.</p>
